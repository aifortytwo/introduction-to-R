# introduction-to-R

This repository is part of the AI42 session Introduction to R with Sine Zambach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV7iWrWGFEc

The participants should get R installed before the meetup. 

You can find a short introduction to installing R here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTqGrlaidLI

If you are 100% new to R we reommend watching the following 10 min video on RStudio and try to follow along what Sine is doing in the video before the session:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKc7nZag0OU

It is an introduction to RStudio and a short demonstration on how to run code and load in a file.

We will use the two attached datafiles (which are also used in the video) during the meetup:

- who_disease.csv
- BagsOfOranges_Fact.xlsx

THere is also a written guide on how to install R in the repo:
